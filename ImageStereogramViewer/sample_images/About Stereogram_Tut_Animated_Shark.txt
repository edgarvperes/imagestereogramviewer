Description: Animated autostereogram featuring a swiming shark

Source: Fred Hsu, March 2005.

Instructions: Watch this image while relaxing your eyes and allowing them to focus behind it 
(diverge) until you see the shark. You should try to start quite near to the screen - as soon as it 
works you can slowly move away.
Some people find this easier to do, but you won't get the intended result (converge): 
Hold your thumb close to the center of the image, and then focus on your thumbnail tip. 
Then while maintaining focus on your thumbnail tip slowly bring your thumb closer to your eyes until
the shark outline shows up. Repeat as necessary until you see the shark outline.
